===========

This is a toy operating system I was developing for fun from mid 2011 to the beginning of 2013.
It works on x86-compatible PCs in the 32-bit protected mode and can do:
* preemptive multitasking
* virtual file systems
* memory management
* supports such just awesome devices as PS/2 keyboard and 24x80 text-mode vga display
* runs from CD :3
