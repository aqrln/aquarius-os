===========

This is a toy operating system I was developing for fun from mid 2011 to the beginning of 2013.
It works on x86-compatible PCs in the 32-bit protected mode and can do:
* preemptive multitasking
* virtual file systems
* memory management
* supports such just awesome devices as PS/2 keyboard and 24x80 text-mode vga display
* runs from CD or a USB pen drive :3

#### Credits

Most of the code is written by me, yet some of it is based on some third-party one,
namely the [James Molloy's kernel development tutorial](http://jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html)
and code snippets on the [OSDev Wiki](http://wiki.osdev.org).
